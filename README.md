# Breast_Cancer_Segmentation_and_Classification

**Aim**
To apply ML/DL algorithms to detect/classify and segment breast cancer. 

The project focuses on building a segmentation and classification model that classifies the breat cancer from the ultrasound images of breast. The links for the models used for segmentation and classification is shown below:

## Final Model Deployment 

I have used streamlit library to deploy my model. A sample prediction is shown below:
